# AI & Computer Vision Assessments

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of an AI and Computer Vision assessment. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and explores a different challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Computer Vision (CV).

##  Projects

### 1. [CYCV000: ID Document Text Line Extraction](./CYCV000/)

*   **Domain:** Computer Vision, Document Analysis
*   **Description:** A pipeline designed to process scanned ID documents and extract individual lines of text as cropped line images. This is a foundational step for OCR and document information extraction systems.

### 2. [GenCV00: VAE Facial Image Generation](./GenCV00/)

*   **Domain:** Computer Vision, Generative Models
*   **Description:** An exploration of a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate novel, creative variations of an input facial image. The project investigates the capabilities and limitations of VAEs for creative image synthesis.

### 3. [homonyms_problem: Contextual Sentiment Analysis](./homonyms_problem/)

*   **Domain:** Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis
*   **Description:** A deep dive into the "Homonyms Problem," where a word's sentiment is dependent on its context. This project compares a classical NLP baseline (GloVe) against modern Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) to demonstrate the superiority of contextual embeddings and analyze their limitations.

### 4. [Semantic_keywords: Advanced Search Engine](./Semantic_keywords/)

*   **Domain:** Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval
*   **Description:** A project to build and compare two different search engines for a corpus of English articles. It contrasts a traditional, keyword-based TF-IDF model with a modern, meaning-based Semantic Search engine to showcase the power of understanding user intent.

## Usage

Each project directory (`CYCV000`, `GenCV00`, etc.) is self-contained and includes its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions on setup, usage, and how to reproduce the results. Please navigate to the respective directory for more information.
